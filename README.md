*ade-daic-woz*
==============================

This is the implementation of an end-to-end system for automatic depression estimation based on speech using DAIC-WOZ database. 

- ADE implementation:
  - Data Pre-processing
  - Training process
  - Evaluating process
- Streamlit app, to perform EDA and allow a more interactive experience with model and data

For this project the DAIC-WOZ Database has been used. Due to consent constraints the data is only distributed to 
academics and other non-profit researchers. You can access the data from this [link](https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/). 
There you should complete, sign and submit a form to apply for the database. Once approved, a link will be sent to you 
to download the data. Enter as input this url in *obtain_dataset.py* to automatize the process.
